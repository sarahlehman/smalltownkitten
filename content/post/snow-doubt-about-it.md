**We’ve been blessed/cursed with two feet of snow.**

**Pro:** I didn’t have to go to work.

**Con:** Clearing snow straight up blows. Actually, it doesn’t blow. If
we had a snowblower, *then* it would blow. But us peasants have a meager
two shovels and it’s straight up tragic.

**Pro:** The majestic beauty of it all. You know. Winter wonderland and
all that fun stuff.

**Con:** Someone once told me snow reminded them of dandruff, so
sometimes I look at snow falling and see a massive quantity of dandruff
coating our vehicles and houses. Obviously it freaks me out. I’m angry
at this person for vocalizing their dandruff-related observation. Oh god
and now I’ve been that person for you. Now you won’t be able to view
snow without thinking of dandruff either. What a terrible, vicious cycle
this is. (The dandruff comparison is especially disturbing when you see
someone doing that cliche “stick your tongue out and catch a few
snowflakes on it” thing. [<span class="underline">Please click this to

*Mmmm, dandruff.*)

**Pro:** I feel a (most likely false) sense of security when there’s a
bunch of snow lining the sides of the road. If I veer off, I won’t hit a
tree. I’m guessing the marshmallow snowbank would still do some damage
(*I’ve never had the distinct pleasure of hitting one before*) but I
don’t think it would split a car in half like one of those malicious
tree trunks.

**Con:** Fishtailing while driving up a large hill and there’s a truck
on your ass and another car coming over the hill in the opposite lane.

**Pro:** Snowballs. They’re fun. *Don’t act like you’re not amused.*

**Con:** People are driving around without cleaning the snow from the
top of their vehicles like they are invincible and there are no
consequences for their actions. It’s very dangerous, but it’s also just
ridiculous. Your red Honda Civic looks like it’s wearing a silly white
hat.

**Pro:** Snow is a ready-made excuse for not going anywhere.

“I’m so sorry I can’t make it to your birthday party, Katie. It’s just
with all of the snow out there… Oh, it’s a virtual party? You know what
it still just doesn’t feel *safe.*”

You can even use the excuse with minimal amounts of snow.

“I don’t care if there’s only a *half-inch* out there, *Katie*, I can’t
make it to your book club. Oh... it’s virtual again? Right. Okay. Well.
Uhm. Unfortunately, I… lost my book… in the snow?”

Okay obviously this excuse works better when you’re not living through a
pandemic, *but you could make it work*. Get creative, people.

**Con:** Pulling out into the road blindly because there are giant snow
piles blocking your vision. Million dollar idea- snow vision goggles.
*Sharks, do you want to invest?* I’m asking for $300k for 20% of the
company. I’ve done *zero* research but I’m feeling motivated and have
some charm. *Is that not enough?*

**Pro:** Watching the snow slowly fall while I’m inside enjoying the
fire. *Soo0oo0oo0o hygge*\! (Look it up.)

**Con:** Coming home after a marathon work day and getting the car stuck
in your own driveway and your boyfriend is trying to save the day in
creative ways like putting wood under the tires(?) to help the car move
but day is turning into night and you’re tired and all of a sudden
*very* mad at your boyfriend, even though he didn’t really do anything
*wrong* per se, but because you’re just cold and because you knew,
despite his optimism, that you shouldn’t have even *attempted* to pull
into the driveway without shoveling more (is this one just me?) Anyway
you hide your anger because you feel it’s ultimately misplaced but
unfortunately he ends up somehow sensing it and now you just feel like
you suck. (Sorry, Justin.)

**Pro:** A massive snowstorm serves as a helpful reminder that you can’t
fight mother nature. She’s in control. Sometimes when we are
successfully managing various aspects of our lives and (thankfully)
nothing awful has happened, we start to believe the dangerous and
alluring lie that we have control over everything. We just don’t. Large
snowstorms (and say, *global pandemics for a totally random example*)
show us we have zero control. So what other choice do you have but to
live with it, learn and adapt?

**Con:** The snow gets dirty and it’s aesthetically awful. There is
nothing less attractive to me than a Wal-Mart parking lot filled with
filthy snow piles. Well, that and a poorly executed circle beard. Or a
guy in finance who only talks about business/economics stuff and uses
terms like “stock options” OR double whammy- a finance guy with a poorly
executed circle beard talking about “stock options.” Total turn off.

A quick note about circle beards before I go-

Please observe that I said *poorly* *executed* circle beard. Did I say I
was against all circle beards? No. For example,
[<span class="underline">see this picture of Leonardo
DiCaprio.</span>](https://www.toptrendsguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Circle-Beard-Styles-1.jpg)
Think
[<span class="underline">Denzel</span>](https://menhairstylist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/denzel-washington-short-curly-hairstyles-for-men.jpg).
Now think [<span class="underline">Denzel years
later</span>](https://hairstylecamp.com/wp-content/uploads/french-beard-7.jpg)
(still killing it). And before you say, “Sarah, these are famous
celebrities. *Of course* they look good with circle beards,” just look
up circle beards in general, okay? There are *stock photos* with circle
beards that are completely *fine* by my standards.
[<span class="underline">THIS is a picture of the poor execution I am
talking
about</span>](http://images.yuku.com/image/jpg/8dd267b654618f45a91540418705dd206af33917_r.jpg).
I’m not into that lack of craftsmanship.
