I get into a morning routine rabbit hole pretty often. It’s usually
midnight on a weekend and I find myself watching videos like “A Healthy
and Productive Morning Routine” and “How to Wake Up at 4AM.” The next
morning, I inevitably end up hating myself for waking up at 11AM and
drinking a cup of coffee (with lots of milk and sugar) before I chug a
gallon of lemon water. (I know. I am a monster.)

This is how it goes.

“I wake up super early.” *Here’s a shot of the star of the video
stretching as the sun is rising. They gaze at their Himalayan salt
lamp.* *White linens abound. We are told this person does not fucking*
dare *look at any screens first thing in the morning, but we wonder what
tools they used to film this, and also how they resist checking Twitter
as soon as their eyes open.*

“After some light stretching, I head straight into the kitchen.” *The
person’s hair is suddenly in a perfect bun??? It honestly looks like
they used one of those top knot guides from QVC, but we went straight
from light stretching to the kitchen sans hair tutorial so we’ll never
know. The kitchen is so organized and clean it looks like they have
never cooked in it. Seriously they have never so much as toasted a
Pop-Tart in here. I would feel comfortable eating a meal directly off of
the shiny floor or using the quartz countertop as a surface for
surgery.*

“I open my cabinet and grab a giant mason jar.” *Cue the white cabinets
filled exclusively with trendy matching dishware. This person wouldn’t
be caught* dead *using a souvenir cup. Do they own a mug that says “I
Love My Jack Russell Terrier”? We don’t know because they have hidden or
completely destroyed it in an effort to look like they have their shit
together.*

“I fill my jar slowly with fresh room temperature water.” *This process
gives the person an opportunity to stare longingly out the window and
reflect on how grateful they are for every single thing that has ever
happened to them*. *Hell, they might even break out a gratitude journal
and jot some things down because they’re just. so. grateful. Do they
have personalized pens? Yes. Do they actually* do *this every day? No.*

“I add my citrus, ginger, and turmeric and drink the entire jar
mindfully.” *If you haven’t noticed, this person is \#mindful. They
don’t actually know what turmeric does just like the rest of us, but
they will pretend they do by saying “you know, like, digestion and
stuff.”*

“After I’ve had my water, I do three hours of mindful stretching and
yoga, followed by one hour of meditation.” *Somehow it’s still only 5AM.
Time has stopped for this person. Fuck the space time continuum. The
laws of physics simply don’t exist here. It is an eerie hellscape filled
with essential oil diffusers and fiddle-leaf fig trees you aren’t sure
are real or fake.*

“By this time, my tummy is getting a little hungry for breakfast. I eat
one egg white and drink a green smoothie.” *This person’s blender
eviscerates an entire apple in .01 seconds, core included.* *It’s always
flawlessly clean, but we’ve never actually seen them complete the
laborious task of scrubbing it. I guess they think it’s too hard to look
sexy while cleaning a blender. (I, for one, disagree. I personally look
hot as hell when I clean mine.)*

My *HUGE* breakfast gives me tons of energy for my next two hours of
exercise. And that’s it\! I’m ready to take on the day\!” *Like and
subscribe, like and subscribe.*

Substitute the lemon water for hot green tea, or the mindful stretching
for a half-marathon. You get the gist. I’m not saying there’s anything
wrong with having a morning routine. I don’t have an issue with
gratitude. I *do*, however, have a problem with people editing their
lives so heavily that it doesn’t include any of the messy, very *real*
parts that everyone has to deal with on a daily basis (e.g. picking
something out of your teeth when no one is looking, smelling your
favorite t-shirt to see if you can wear it again before washing it, or
bagging up your dog’s shit in the pouring rain). They have altered their
reality so much that it doesn’t even look believable anymore, and then
they double down by trying to sell it to other people as real life. We
watch these videos and become convinced we’re in the wrong for actually
*living.*

So my advice to myself and to others is don’t be afraid to drink your
coffee before your water. (I’m not a doctor, but I’m pretty sure your
stomach isn’t going to combust. And if it does, I think there was an
underlying issue.) Don’t be ashamed to sleep in on your day off. And if
you hate green smoothies, don’t drink them. No one wants to clean kale
out of their blender anyway, even if you do look damn fine doing it.
