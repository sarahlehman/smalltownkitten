**To the person who told me about their colleague’s kidney stones-**

My friend told me that a woman he knew was passing, and I quote, "a shit
ton of kidney stones." He then proceeded to explain that the reason for
the copious amount of stones was the quantity of tea she had been
drinking. He conveniently told me this *while I was drinking tea*. He
had no other details. :facepalm:

I'm sorry but you cannot just *not* provide further information. What
kind of tea was she drinking? Was it the powdery kind you stir in? Was
it a Lipton situation? Green? Black? Oolong? Is there a lawsuit pending,
or is this a common-knowledge-drink-at-your-own-risk type deal? Should
it come with a warning? Should we alert the Surgeon General? (I
personally don’t know much about the Surgeon General’s job
responsibilities, but I know for damn sure I’ve seen the title on
bottles of liquor and there seem to be parallels here?)

I’m now afraid of something I didn't even know I had to fear. Every time
I have any kind of discomfort, I assume I’m going to piss out a pebble.
I can only hope that my stones are not as plentiful as the stones of
this poor nameless woman.

Why did you tell me this?\!?\!?
