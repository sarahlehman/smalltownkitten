I was in the hardware store and a man working there asked me if I wanted
to phone my husband because I looked so confused. Phone my husband?
First of all, I’m not even married. Second, what if I have a wife?
Third, isn’t it *your* job to help people in this store? Are you just
relying on people’s significant others to tell them what to buy? What
kind of business model is this? And finally, I will not be “phoning”
anyone. If I have to ask my boyfriend something, I am going to text him,
walk around your store aimlessly waiting for him to respond, use your
bathroom, and then buy a candle on my way out when I don’t get an answer
within 15 minutes because even though this store is part of a chain, I
for some reason feel bad not buying anything. Okay? That is how I do
*business*, sir. That’s also why I own so many candles, and why my house
always smells like a mix of citrus, french vanilla, and patchouli. Oh
but also next time I’m in here, if you should be so lucky, I will
definitely need assistance determining exactly which metal bracket to
buy. Thank you.
