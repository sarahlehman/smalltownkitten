Too loud, too emotional, too ambitious, too passionate, too irrational,
etc…

You *are* too much. You are too kind, too funny, too joyful, too clever…

You are too good to spend your time worrying about what other people
think (*especially* the people who are making you feel like being “too
much” is a bad thing, the people who are throwing around “too much” like
it’s an insult). You’re a lot of love and a lot of laughter.

Our “too much” makes the world just right, if you ask me.

...and if you ask me if “ranting” is inherently negative, my answer
would be no\! :smiley:
