I listened to an acquaintance retell and revel in their high school
experiences. He was the star quarterback. Although injuries prevented
him from going pro (likely story), people *urged* him to never give up
the game because of his *immense* talent. He got along with *all* of the
kids in school and couldn’t decide what table to sit at for lunch
because *everyone* wanted to be his friend. He slept through calculus
and *still* managed to get A’s on the tests. And on and on…

Using some basic math skills, (I don’t even need to take calculus to
figure this out and good thing, because guess what I didn’t) I can
deduce that these supposedly real events occurred 25 to 30 years ago. I
think in order to show others how it feels to listen to this, I will
start bragging about things *I* achieved 25 to 30 years ago. “Oh my god,
guys, at twelve months of age, I started walking, and let me tell you,
all *hell* broke loose. My parents were *so* proud. And I was *so* fast,
they had a hard time catching me\! Also did you guys know I started
holding a spoon by myself at 8 months? I mean, that’s pretty early. I
can still do it to this day. *Watch*.”

It sounds kind of ridiculous, doesn’t it?

Please talk about new things so that I can stop feigning interest in the
fact that you had a spoiler on your car and could open your locker in
less than 15 seconds. Thank you, and I look forward to talking about
things with you in the future, like maybe even things we did as recently
as yesterday, or things we will do tomorrow.
