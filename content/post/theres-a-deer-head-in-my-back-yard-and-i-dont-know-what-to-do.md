Last month I looked out our bedroom window and noticed a uniquely shaped
stick in our back yard. The stick appeared to be protruding out from a
larger log and was mostly covered with leaves. There was an odd curve to
it that didn’t seem right to me, and I thought “Wow, that really looks
like an antler. Weird.” As the weeks passed and the wind continued to
blow the leaves into our neighbor’s yard (they love that), things were
unfortunately shaping up to be very antler-like. And then one day I
peered out the window and it was clear there was a dead deer behind our
house.

We went outside to confirm that there was in fact a deceased deer out
there, a trip no one ever wants to take, and sure enough we found a deer
head laying on the ground. To make matters more unsettling, there was no
actual body to be seen. (Not that I *wanted* to find the body of a deer,
but I also didn’t want to *not* find a dead deer body if you know what I
mean.)

*So where is the body?*

**Scenario 1: Our neighbors are sending us a message.**

We have offended our neighbors in some way and they have placed this
deer head here as a warning. This is their way of telling us to get the
fuck out. Have I been too loud while rolling the trash can over the
gravel driveway at 7:00 in the morning? Can the neighbors somehow hear
what we are saying about them? Do they actually see the (maybe)
(sometimes) illicit things we are doing in our home? I don’t know, but I
do know that I am now looking into thicker curtains, and that their
twisted message has been received loud and clear. (This is sadistic even
for you Eileen.)

**Scenario 2: An animal, e.g. a coyote, scavenged this head from a
nearby body (hit by a car?) and dropped it in our back yard en route to
its final destination (a.k.a. its murder den).**

This scenario might scare you, but it’s a possibility I’m actually kind
of excited about. I’m feeling very Nat Geo about the whole thing. We
might get a night vision camera to see what goes on out there and I’m
hoping the bears and turkeys are having nocturnal tea parties and/or
raves. I don’t claim to know their proclivities at this point, but I’m
interested in really getting to know them. (David Attenborough vibes.)

**Scenario 3: The deer died here, in this very spot, and the body has
somehow disintegrated into the ground or up into the sky (Sirius Black
style) (shit sorry spoiler alert).**

I don’t like this scenario. There is a fallen tree next to the head and
I’m concerned that the tree crushed the innocent animal. I’m not taking
this lightly. I’ve also learned about something called CWD (Chronic
Wasting Disease) in which a deer literally CONSUMES ITSELF. So I am now
envisioning a deer eating its ENTIRE BODY and then finally dying once
only the head remains, even though that is most definitely not possible.

Personally I would pick scenario two *any* day of the week and I plan to
continue living my life as if that’s what happened. But no matter how we
got to this point, we have to decide how to move forward.

**Option 1:** We dig (Justin digs) a deep hole near the head and we bury
(Justin buries) the damn thing. We forget about it entirely, and hope a
child who someday inhabits this house after us doesn’t discover the
remains during a dino dig themed activity.

**Option 1a:** We still bury it, but we exhume the head in a couple
years after nature has taken its course. We hopefully find a pair of
clean antlers, which I then give to my dad for Father’s Day. I
consequently win some sort of best daughter award.

**Option 2:** My coworker (an avid hunter) has suggested I *boil* the
fucking thing in a large barrel filled with some sort of OxiClean
mixture\* (?\!?\!) while removing bits of the deer using some kind of
tool (???\!\!\!) to eventually reveal a spotless set of antlers (which I
still give to my dad for Father’s Day). WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK. This
option would involve me scraping off the poor deer’s NOSE (because guess
what it still has a NOSE) from the poor deer’s HEAD. I cannot imagine
executing this option without crying and having a full on mental
breakdown. I absolutely will not do this and option two is frankly off
the table.

**Option 3:** We continue with what we have been doing up until this
point- nothing. We let it rot. We look at the head on occasion and
think, “Oh yeah we should really deal with that” and then walk into the
kitchen for a snack.

**Option 3a:** We still do nothing. The hypothetical coyote comes back
for it, and we score some footage on our new night vision camera that
could potentially garner 15 to 20 views on YouTube.

HELP.
