**Things I’d rather do than go to work on Monday-**

Have a UTI

alive)

Flat tire, sans roadside assistance

Go to gynecologist (presumably for my two aforementioned UTIs and
unusually long period)

Burn my tongue

Lick an ATM

Notice that there is no toilet paper in a public bathroom stall after I
have defecated, meaning I have to quickly relocate to another stall,
praying that no one walks in and sees me pantsless and unwiped in the 3
second duration it takes to make it to the safety of the second stall

Slip on ice (hit head)

Social media doom scroll

Splinter under nail

procure a key)

trifecta)

Cheese Medley Pierogies (I am NOT speaking from experience on this one)

Smoke a cigarette backwards

Get a haircut that I thought would look cool but is actually too short
and now I am crying in the parking lot of a Hair Cuttery

Gut and stuff a Thanksgiving turkey

Small talk with neighbor in produce section

Small talk with neighbor in line at cash register after we have already
had a run-in at produce

Flossing (teeth, and viral dance craze)

watching
