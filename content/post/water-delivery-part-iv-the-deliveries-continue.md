I haven’t thought much of my water delivery dilemma recently. It has
been smooth sailing (delivering). Water-delivery-guy number two even
apologized for tracking snow into the building during a recent drop-off.
Not even his fault, the little angel.

As for water-delivery-guy number one, his whereabouts are still a
mystery. I’m starting to think he won’t ever return. (I don’t know about
you, but my mind goes right to scandal. I have a sense he resigned in
disgrace.) It doesn’t matter. It’s his loss. Literally. The poor man
might have lost his job. But I’m over him. We’re both looking for
different things. If he can’t handle me at my worst, he doesn’t deserve
me at my best. Am I just stating cliché break up phrases now? Yes.
Bottom line is I’ve moved on.

During the last delivery, water-delivery-guy number two returned once
again. And as soon as he walked through the damn door and the frigid air
followed him in, he looked directly into my eyes with those baby blues
and said “Hi, Sarah. How are you today?” This mother fucker knew my name
*immediately*.

Yes, thank you. We are very happy. And water-delivery-guy number one,
you *are* invited if you are mature enough to handle it.

But seriously, is it just me? Does water-delivery-guy number two know
every customer’s name? Is he some kind of savant? Is he stalking me? Is
it self-involved and/or paranoid to think the person delivering water to
your workplace might potentially be stalking you just because they know
your name? I don’t know and I don’t care. I could listen to his small
talk about the weather while the receipt prints *any* day of the week
(usually Wednesdays, obviously, but I’m open to other possibilities).
