My name is Sarah and I grew up in rural Pennsylvania. I left for a brief stint in the city, bagged me a boy toy, and now I’m an adult in rural Pennsylvania. I basically kidnapped this guy. (Just kidding. He wants to be here, I think. Also I kind of lied about the boy toy thing. He’s actually my long-term domestic partner, but boy toy just sounds so much more _exciting!_) We live in a small town in a small house with a cat named Nugget. Some days I like my cat more than I like myself, but I’m working on it. 

I write about things I observe and things that happen to me. These things are factual and may or may not be exaggerated. (_I have a flair for the dramatic._) By this point you’re probably thinking, “Woah this girl really likes her parentheses.” You’re not wrong. If you’re not into parentheses that don’t necessarily follow the rules (you know, those bad-ass rebel parentheses that just don’t give a _fuuuuck_), you might not like it here. Same goes for gratuitous commas and nonsensical hashtags.

But if you _do_ like the blog, you can subscribe and receive an email from me on occasion. Probably once a month, but the jury is still out. _I’m constantly changing and evolving, okay?_ You can also follow me on Twitter, where I currently have two followers. Or you can do none of the above. You can leave, never come back, and pretend like this didn’t happen.

I hope you don’t choose that last one, though. Don’t go for the nuclear option.
